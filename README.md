# Matplotlib-challenge
## Primary Coding Language and skills: Python with Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook with Matplotlib
Your tasks are to do the following:

Using data provided which contains results from an animal study testing drug regimens for tumor treatment, complete the following tasks:
  - Remove duplicate time points
  - Generate summary table of drug regimens and tumor volumes consisting of the follow statistics: 
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Variance
    - Standard Deviation
    - SEM
  - Generate a bar plot that shows that total number of mice in each drug treatment regimen using both Matplotlib and DataFrame.plot()
  - Generate a pie plot that shows the distribution of female and male mice in the study using both Matplotlib and DataFrame.plot()
  - Calculate final tumor volume of each mouse is 4 treatment regimens
    - Calculate quartiles and IQR
    - Quantitatively determine potential outliers

  - Generate box and whisker plot of final tumor volume across 4 treatment regimens, highlight outliers by changing color and style

  - Generate a line plot of tumor volume vs. time point for one mouse

  - Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for one treatment regimen
  - Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for one treatment regimen
    - Plot linear regression model on top of scatter plot
